Here is the Web-Design-Challenege hw.

This is also posted in my repo for the webpage, that will be linked.

This website creation was fun, once it got rolling of course. This definitely had me staring at a blank screen for a while wondering where to start, but once it gets going it really does snowball, and its interesting to see it come into final form. 

I did a cost of living site from our first project. It was just 1 of many pieces of data we used for the project but thought it was an interesting piece. This shows the cost of living for 1 bedroom and 3 bedroom apartments across a number of larger cities in the USA. It also has a utlities page and an overall cost of living where all the numbers were put together to try to find a realistic round-about price of what it will cost all said-and-done.

the index.html is the landing page and the main page for the site. It has all necessary criteria from the readme. the dropdown shows each page, there are links spread throughout the pages to navigate, has the raw data table used and a comparison page for side-by-side visuals.

there may be a bug present when you open it, just not sure if it is taking longer to show. I originally made the site to match what you supplied, then when reading the bonus I saw we could use another data set so I changed it completely. It seems to initiall open the old way, then upon clicking anything shows the correct page. Hopefully thats not present when you open it, not sure why its happening or how to fix it. I think it just didnt fully load yet.
